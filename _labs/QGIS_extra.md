title: QGIS Extra
---

This is an additional resource developed by Charlotte Lyddon and based on
material from Nick Bearman, that shows how to create a choropleth using QGIS.
The main aim is to show how to reproduce a figure similar to [this one](../content/labs/lab_04.html#Raster-basemaps) produced in
Lab 4.
