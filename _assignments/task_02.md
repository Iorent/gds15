### *Targetting areas*

* Type: `Coursework`
* [Equivalent to 2,500 words] Three maps/tables, code and 750 words.
* Released on Week 9
* 50% of the final mark
* Chance to be reassessed
* Final Assessment

In this assignment, you will take the role of a real-world data scientist
tasked to identify areas to direct investments. Choose one of the two
scenarios suggested below (or create one of your own).
Choose one of the given questions, develop a data
strategy, deploy it, and present the results in a rigorous but intuitive
fashion, together with the code.

**NOTE**: if you are thinking on taking a different scenario of your own,
please consult with the module lead, {{ site.data.instructor.name }}.

**Minimum requirements** (complete *all*)

* Combine *at least two* datasets, potentially among those used in the course.
* Employ *at least two* techniques from the set of analytics covered in the
  course.
* Provide a clear final answer to the question that guided your analysis.
* Include documented code and data that allow the replication of the analysis
  presented.

**Scenarios suggested** (select *only one*)

* You are consulting for the Birmingham City Council on a program to target
  investments towards particularly disadvantaged areas that are nevertheless
  popular or have the potential to become. The Economic Development division
  knows that only five local super output areas (LSOAs) will be funded but
  would like to know which ones.
* A large foreign coffee retailer is looking to create a presence in
  Oxford by building a series of coffee-shops that cater to commuters. Since
  they do not have much of an idea of the commuting reality in Bristol, they
  require a report that identifies the top three residential and workplace
  areas (LSOA, in particular) in town as well as whether there exist any
  relevant cluster of either of these. In addition, they require the main 
  factors behind such flows, asking for at least five relevant predictors
  of commuting between two areas.

**Data**

This assignment can use any of the [datasets]({{site.baseurl}}/datasets.html)
employed in the course, and/or any other datasets you consider useful. If you are 
thinking of including additional datasets, or have ideas in this respect,
please get in touch with the module lead
