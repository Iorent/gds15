*"Data graphics **visually display measured quantities** by means of the **combined
use** of points, lines, a coordinate system, numbers, symbols, words, shading,
and color."*

*The Visual Display of Quantitative Information*. Edward R. Tufte.

## A bit of history

<center>
Maps --> Data Maps (XVIIth.C.) --> Time series (1786) --> Scatter plots
</center>

* Surprisingly recent: 1750-1800 approx. (much later than many other
  advances in math and stats!)
* **William Playfair**'s *"linear arithmetic"*: encode/replace numbers in
  tables into visual representations.
* Other relevant names throughout history: Lambert, Minard, Marey.

*"The most extensive data maps [...] place millions of bits of information on
a single page before our eyes. No other method for the display of statistical
information is so powerful"*

# Visualization

*The Visual Display of Quantitative Information*. Edward R. Tufte.

* By **encoding information visually**, they allow to present **large amounts** of
  numbers in a **meaninful** way.
* If well made, visualizations provide leads into the processes underlying the
  graphic.

# Geovisualization

## MacEachren (1994)

> **Geographic visualization** can be defined as the use of concrete visual
> representations --whether on paper or through computer displays or other
> media--to **make spatial contexts and problems visible**, so as to engage
> the most powerful **human information processing** abilities, those
> associated with vision.

## GeoVisualization

* End goal is not to replace the human *in the loop*, but to **augment** her/him.
* Augmentation here comes through engaging the pattern recognition
  capabilities that our brain inherently has.
* Combines:
    * Traditional maps
    * Statistical maps
    * Statistical devices of other kind (charts, scatter plots, etc.)
* Different roles in the analysis process...

## A map for everyone

Maps can fulfill several needs

Depending on which one we want to stress, the best map will look very
different

MacEachren & Kraak (1997) identify three main dimensions:

* Knowledge of what is being plotted
* Target audience
* Degree of interactivity

## A map for everyone

[MacEachren & Kraak (1997) map cube]

## Un/known: *fast* and *slow* maps

## Fast maps

[Amsterdam postcode polygons]

## Slow maps

[Amsterdam twitterhoods final]

## Audience: *easy* and *hard* maps

The larger and non-specialized the audience, the less you can assume about
what they know, hence less information can be emedded

Highly specialized maps are not particularly compelling to the general eye,
but they contain a lot of specific information that can be easily decoded by
the trained eye

This changes with statistical/geographic literacy (the minimum grows)

Pro-tip: know your audience and optimize for it

## Easy map

[easy map figure: screenshot of where train stations are]

## Hard map

[hard map figure: Arribas-Bel & Gerritse (2012)]

## Interaction: one or many maps in one

Talk about interaction, oportunity for discovery, and the end-user as explorer
rather than mere consumer

Interactivity, however, not always desired: sometimes you need one-message,
clear maps to make a case and you don't have time for rich interactive one. It
also takes much more time (althought changing)

The human brain is so good a picking up patterns...

... that it finds them even where they don't exist!

* Patternicity (Shermer, 2008)

> *The tendencey to find meaningful patterns in meaningless noise*

* Apophenia (Konrad, 1958)

Statistics to rescue!!!

* Complement and enhance visuals
* Help disentangling **true** from **spurious** patterns (a.k.a. identifying
  the "Jesus on the toast")
* Reciprocity: GeoVis can also enhance statistics and make them more useful
